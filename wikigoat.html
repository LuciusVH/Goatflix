                        <p>Toy goats have become a pet, just as dogs or cats. Except that it is actually more useful for your garden. The goat is going to clear your garden of brambles, woody plants and bushes, even nettle (once dried)!</p>
                        <p>They are born from a breeding between the smallest goat races, mostly originating in Senegal and Tibet, where the living conditions are tough. The dwarf goat is part of the Bovidae family, and the subfamily Caprinae, just like
                            other goats and sheeps.</p>
                        <p>It is a very rustic and hardy animal with a life expectancy from 10 to 15 years. They can weight between 15 and 30kg and their sizes varies from 42cm at withers for the "toy" or "extra-toy" labelled goats, and up to 50cm at withers
                            for the "dwarf" or "extra dwarf" labelled goats.</p>
                        <img src="assets/img/pupil.jpg" alt="Close up on a goat's rectangular pupil">
                        <p>You may have noticed that dwarf goats (and goats in general) have rectangular pupils! Weird, no? Several reasons to that:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Thanks to this shaped pupil, they have a panorama vision. In the wild, this helps them spot predators rapidly on a broad range. Even when they are grazing, their vision is aligned on the horizon so they don't get surprised
                                    by an unwelcomed visitor...</li>
                                <li>Their whole vision field is clear, not like us with rounded pupils. When you focus your eyes on something, the surrounding of that focus point is blurred, right? Not them! When running away from predators, they are able
                                    to have a clear vision of the ground and what's ahead.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <p>Toy goats are really friendly animals that can be pet or walk like dogs. If the goat has been tamed from her birth, it will be even more social and you will be able to educate it easily. They also love playing around in the woods,
                            but if you take them in the forest, have them leashed because running away is their absolute favorite activity!</p>
                        <p>Male individuals are more social than female ones, but they are very stubborn farm animals... You must lay rules down and stick to them. Otherwise, you may be surprised by their naughty behavior...!</p>
                        <p>If the goats have not been early tamed, they can be very wild and fearfull, then you must be really patient to get accepted. </p>

                        <p>There are no specific rule of thumb in order to know if the size of your garden or field is suitable for your goat. It is advised to have a space of minimum 200sqm for one goat, and then 100sqm more per extra goat.</p>
                        <p>Some people raise dwarf goats on smaller fields (~100sqm), but they are very playful animals and it is best to offer them a decent play field so they can enjoy and be happy. Also the smaller the field, the riskier it is for your
                            goats to catch parasites, and they are very sensitive to these... You must treat and deworm them twice a year.</p>

                        <p>It is important that their shelter is aerated: goats hate rain, drafts and humidity. A good quality shelter is essential during winter and rainy days. A wooden shelter is the best for the winter times, because warmer. Make sure
                            it is ventilated and bright enough.</p>
                        <p>The shelter's ground must be easily cleaned: spread a wood-fiber/sawdust layer, to absorb most of the urine, then cover with a straw layer. By adding to the top straw layer regularly, it stays clean and dry. This way helps reduce
                            the deep cleaning to a 6 weeks frequency.</p>

                        <p>The dwarf goats are clever enough to select their food, which helps reduce the poisining risk. However, take care not to feed them with potatoes, cabbages, or some plants like laurel, ivy, yew... Here is a list of adapted aliments
                            for your goats:
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Herbs</b> (bushes, leaves)</li>
                                <li><b>Straw</b> (especially during winter)</li>
                                <li><b>Hard bread</b> (but in small quantities, cutted in pieces and <u>never wet!</u>)</li>
                                <li><b>Cereals</b> (100g of corn/oat/barley per goat, <u>avoid wheat</u>)</li>
                                <li><b>Vegetables</b> (carots, celery, spinach, ...)</li>
                                <li><b>Fruits</b> (apples, pears, apricots, banana peels, ...)</li>
                                <li><b>Water</b> (always a clean bucket of water)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>To ensure the daily intakes in salts and minerals, you can add salt blocks. They are sold as blocks to be licked, and the best is to choose those specially made for goats. A dwarf goat needs around <b>100g to 200g of concentrated aliments
                        daily</b>, to meet the needs in minerals in vitamins.</p>

                        <p>The sexual maturity of dwarf goats varies a lot from one individual to another, and can happend between 3 to 12 months. Most of the time, it happens around 6-7 months. Unless their bigger cousines, the dwarf goats can give birth
                            anytime in the year. Then it is important to separate male and females individuals, except during your selected breeding season, in order to preserve and do not exhaust the females.</p>
                        <p>The gestation period is around 150 days, as it is for regular goats. The oestrum of the females lasts around 48h and happen every 3 weeks. The dwarf goats usually give birth to one or two baby goats, rarely more. When expecting,
                            the female goat will isolate herself from the herd to get more tranquility, but won't go too far since it is in their DNA to stay together in order to protect each other from the dangers in the wild. You can withdraw the baby
                            from its mother after a 3 months period.

                    <p>In the ancient Greek mythology, Pan is the god of the wild, the sheperds and flocks. He's generally considered as the son of Hermes (Greek god of commerce, speed, roads & divine messenger) and a wood nymph.</p>
                    <p>The upper part of his body is human, with the addition of the horns on his head, while the bottom part is definitely from a goat. He's described as very facetious, short-tempered and quite... Let's say he really enjoyed the company
                        of the beautiful nymphs. And naps, he actually loved naps probably more than nymphs!</p>
                    <p>Pan is very often represented with a pan flute, which he allegedly invented and created. The god was very proud of his music skills, so much that he challenged the great Appolo (Greek god of music and arts, healing and oracles) in
                        a trial of skill. Which he lost...</p>
                    <p>Did you know that the word <i>"panic"</i> comes from his name? Especially if disturbed when napping, Pan became really upset and was able to let out an angry, blood-curdling shout which inspired a sudden sensation of fear and anxiety
                        in everyone unfortunate enough to hear it.</p>

                    <p>The Zodiac originated in China and includes 12 signs. The cycle is based on the lunar calendar and each sign represents a year, rather than a month as per our western zodiac.</p>
                    <p>The Goat is the 8th sign of the Zodiac and the year of the Goat brings promise and prosperity.</p>
                    <p>The Chinese lunar calendar isn't fixed like the western one, hence the new year begins sometime between late January to mid-to-late February. Those born during the Goat year are believed to be peace-loving, kind and popular in the
                        Chinese astrology. Their element is Earth, lucky numbers are 2, 3, 4, 7 and 9 while their colors are green, red and purple. </p>
