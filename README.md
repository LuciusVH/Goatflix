</p>



Hi there and welcome! 

This is a website created as my first Milestone Project for the Full Stack Developer Course of Code Institute, after completing the three first modules : HTML, CSS & User Centric Front End Development. 

<u>**It's a static website only**</u> (except for the "Go to the top" button feature & the contact and photo galleries modals), which means the contact form is currently redirecting answers to Code Institute dumpster server (https://formdump.codeinstitute.net).

You can find the deployed site [here](https://luciusvh.github.io/goatflix/).

> **NOTE:** The links included in this README will not automatically open in a new tab. Press CTRL+ click on the link to open the target in a new tab.

## UX

This website is for goats enthusiasts, more specifically Nigerian dwarf goats (which means basically everyone, as everyone loves these little jumping :goat: !). Goatflix provides the possibility to book a 5mn videocall with one of the owner's goat for 5 EUR. It also displays, with a touch of humor, some facts about these animals and tips if you intend to adopt some yourself. 

### 	Structure & Design

Goatflix is structured in a 2 pages website, each divided in several sections. It also includes a 404 page. The general theme is heavily inspired by the streaming website [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com) (and so is the name :wink:).

On large screens, the [index.html page](https://github.com/LuciusVH/goatflix/blob/main/assets/img/wireframes/index-lg.png) (clicking opens up the wireframe picture) is divided in 3 different sections:

1. The callout section, displaying a large hero image in the background, the logo on the top left corner, a Call To Action (CTA) link on the top right corner opening up the contact modal form to book a videocall, a title & text paragraphs followed by another CTA link anchored to the next section (leading the user towards the rest of the webpage). 

2. The "Stars" section, displaying 5 different Nigerian dwarf goats: each with a picture, name, text description of their character & fun facts and finally a CTA button, opening up the contact modal form in order to book a videocall.

3. The customers reviews section, displaying 2 reviews: picture of the customer & text review. 

The navbar appears only once the user has reached the "stars" section, allowing the landing area to have an even more important impact. Once showing up, the navbar is fixed to the top of the screen, overlaying the rest of the content. The navbar displays:

1. The Goatflix logo on the left side, linking to the index.html, as it is conventional.
2. A set of links, from left to right, on the right side of the navbar: "Home", "Our Stars", "Wikigoat" & "Contact". The "Wikigoat" link is a dropdown menu, revealing 2 sub-links: "General info" & "Famous goats". Those two links take the user to the second page of the website.

On a tablet screen, the "Our stars" display changes : the goat picture & CTA button are now side-to-side, with the goat description under them.

On a mobile screens, the main change on [index.html](https://github.com/LuciusVH/goatflix/blob/main/assets/img/wireframes/index-sm.png) is that the navbar links get hidden under a *"hamburger"* icon on the right side, while the logo picture remains on the left. "Our stars" display changes again, with now a picture of the goat, the description and then the CTA button, all on top of another. The customer reviews section only displays the reviews, no more customer picture. 

The footer, for its part, displays links to different social networks, and the copyright mention below them.

The [wikigoat.html page](https://github.com/LuciusVH/goatflix/blob/main/assets/img/wireframes/wikigoat-lg.png) is divided in 2 sections:

1. The landing section, displaying a small intro text, a table of content to navigate easily into the info & tips, and the content divided in sections & sub-sections. Three pictures are displayed, in the middle of the content. 

2. The "Famous goats" section is replicating the design of the "Stars" section, with a picture, the name and a text description for each goat, minus the CTA button. Each article includes a link to Wikipedia, for more info. 

On mobile screens, [wikigoat.html](https://github.com/LuciusVH/goatflix/blob/main/assets/img/wireframes/wikigoat-sm.png) will be basically the same but with the side margins reduced to a minimum. As with "Our stars", the "Famous goats" display changes for a more vertical one : picture, name & text on top of another instead of side-by-side. 

Finally, when clicked on one of the [contact](https://github.com/LuciusVH/goatflix/blob/main/assets/img/wireframes/contactmodal-lg.png) links, the form opens up in a modal alert, overlaying the rest of the website. It shows a picture of Philoctetes (a goat-ish Disney character), side-by-side with the title "Contact & booking". Following, two inputs for the user's name & email and a text area for the message, a "submit" button & a "reset" button. The label for each input and text area is displayed on the left of its respective field. The placeholders displays "Philoctetes" in the name field, "phil@disney.com" (fictional email address) & a Phil's line in the message field, taken from the Disney animation movie *Hercules* (best Disney <u>ever</u>, thanks). 

On mobile screens, the [modal contact form](https://github.com/LuciusVH/goatflix/blob/main/assets/img/wireframes/contactmodal-sm.png) is basically the same but with no picture and each input and text area is displayed below its own label instead of next to each other.

The fonts are taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/):

- The titles font is [Bebas Neue](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bebas+Neue).
- The regular font is [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), chosen because identified as "popular pairing" with Bebas Neue. 
- [Helvetica](https://downloadhelvetica.com/) has been chosen as default font, if the others can't load for any reason, as it is reputed to be the perfect font and actually has a quite interesting [documentary](https://downloadhelvetica.com/helvetica-movie/) dedicated to it :movie_camera: â€‹! 

The logo has been designed using [FontMeme](https://fontmeme.com/netflix-font/), because I don't know how to curve the font in order to replicate the Netflix's logo. After some research, I found that I could somehow do it using SVG but FontMeme provided me with a decent result with less effort, though I will definitely have a look at SVG later on, it seems quite interesting when paired with CSS. 

### User stories

- As a potential customer, I want to find information on the service (price, how does it work, etc.) and how to book the videocall easily.

- As a potential customer, I want to be able to read other customers' reviews before purchasing myself.

- As an aspiring goat owner, I want to find information about Nigerian dwarf goats. 

- As a parent, I want my child to learn about goats in a funny way. 

- As a coworker, I want to make a joke to my colleagues and have a goat in our next team videocall. 



## Features

### Existing Features

- <u>Landing area</u> - this section is a call to action (CTA), helping the customer to get quickly booking his videocall through the contact form, with the CTA link on the top right corner, or the potential customer to get more info on the goats with the CTA button "Meet our stars" under the title. 
- <u>Navbar</u> - allows the user to easily navigate to any section of the website. It's been made sticky, so the navbar stays on the top of the screen, once the uses has reached the "stars" section, and straight on the top of the wikigoat.html page (no landing/CTA section on this page). 
- <u>Stars section</u> - helps the user to familiarize himself/herself with some of the goats available for videocall. Each goat's card also displays a CTA link inviting the customer to book his videocall through the contact form.
- <u>Customer reviews section</u> - allows the potential customer to get a feedback from previous customers and helps the decision process (as if seeing these cute goats wasn't sufficient enough!!)
- <u>General info section</u> - allows the user to get info about these animals, and pro tips if he/she is planning to get a goat himself/herself (or actually a couple of goats, at least, as it's explained in the section :wink:). 
- <u>Table Of Content</u> - allows the user to navigate easily within the General info section. 
- <u>Famous goats section</u> - allows the user to learn more about some of the most eminent members of the goat community, whether they are real or fictional. 
- <u>Footer</u> - informs and leads the user towards the breeding farm's social media accounts, and displays the copyright mention. 
- <u>Image modal</u> - allows the user to visualize the picture in bigger size.
- <u>Contact modal</u> - allows the user to contact the goats owner, to set up a videocall or ask any question they may have. This website being a static website only built for educational purposes, the contact form is currently redirecting answers to Code Institute dumpster server (https://formdump.codeinstitute.net).
- <u>Favicon</u> - allows the user to find more easily the Goatflix tab in his/her browser & improve SEO.
- <u>"Go to the top" button</u> - allows the user to get to the top of the webpage instantly, without having to scroll his/her way back up.
- <u>404 page</u> - inform the user, with a humoristic touch, that something went wrong and invites her/him to go back to the actual content.

### Features Left to Implement

- <u>Booking system</u> - allows the user to book her/his preferred time through the contact modal directly. I don't have the knowledge yet to build such a feature.

## Testing

The website has been tested automatically through W3C HTML & CSS validators, also with Lighthouse. 

### HTML Validator ([W3C](https://validator.w3.org/))

**index.html** 

- Element `<figcaption>` cannot be nested inside element `<blockquote>` x2 (lines 264 & 279) - <u>corrected</u>

I switched the `<figcaption>` elements for a regular `<p>` & modified CSS to realigned the newly created `<p>`. 

- Useless closing tag `</button>` x2 (lines 371 & 372) - <u>corrected</u>

Closing tags deleted.

**wikigoat.html** 

- Element [`ol`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#the-ol-element) not allowed as child of element [`ol`](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#the-ol-element) in this context x3 (lines 70, 74 & 75) - <u>corrected</u>

These errors were spotted in the structure of the Table of Content. After researching, I learned that list-nested `<ol>` & `<ul>` must be inside a `<li>`.  This also helped me restructure the Table of Content properly, thanks to this [Stack Overflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10405945/html-ordered-list-1-1-1-2-nested-counters-and-scope-not-working). 

- No `p` element in scope but a `p` end tag seen x2 (lines 106 & 157) - <u>corrected</u>

I had nested the `<ul>` inside the `<p>`, so I changed and closed the `<p>` before to open the `<ul>`.

- Useless closing tag `</button>` x2 (lines 341 & 342) - <u>corrected</u>

Closing tags deleted.

**404.html**

- No error found.

### CSS Validator ([W3C](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator.html))

- Property `text-decoration-thickness` doesn't exist.

After checking with [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/), this property works on all updated computer browsers so I decided to go forward with it anyway. It doesn't matter if this effect doesn't work on some mobile devices, as there's no real hovering on mobile.

The website has also been tested manually, all along its creation. I personally tested and checked it with Chrome, Mozilla Firefox & Microsoft Edge. Thanks to Chrome DevTools, I emulated the following screenviews and made the website responsive on each of the following device:

- Moto G4
- Galaxy S5
- iPhone 5/SE
- iPhone 6/7/8
- iPhone 6/8/8 Plus
- iPhone X
- iPad
- iPad Pro
- Surface Duo

I also used my own Huawei P20 to test it. 

#### Link testing:

**Navbar, on all pages** 

- "Home" loads *index.html*.
- "Our Stars" loads *index.html*, links to "our-stars" ID. 
- "Wikigoat" displays a dropdown menu:
  - "General info" loads *wikigoat.html*, links to "general-info" ID.
  - "Famous goats" loads *wikigoat.html*, links to "famous-goats" ID.
- "Contact us" loads the contact modal.

**index.html**

- "Book now!" CTA button loads the contact modal.
- "Meet our stars!" CTA button links to "our-stars" ID.
- Clicking on each goat polaroid loads a photo gallery of its respective goat. 
- "Book me!" CTA button loads the contact modal, on big screens / "Book Galak/Orion/Lili/Djali/Cereale!" CTA button loads the contact modal, on small screens.

**wikigoat.html**

- Each of the 7 Table of Content's links leads to its respective article. 
- Each of the 3 Wikipedia's links, on the Famous Goats section, leads to its respective Wikipedia page.

**Social links, on index.html & wikigoat.html**

- "Facebook" loads https://www.facebook.com/.
- "Instagram" loads https://www.instagram.com/.
- "YouTube" loads https://www.youtube.com/.



#### Spotted bugs & errors:

- On the contact form, the `datetime-local` input does not work on [Mozilla Firefox](https://github.com/LuciusVH/goatflix/blob/main/assets/img/readme/mz-dateinput.png) (link to screenshot). Instead, it displays a regular `text` input, which is okay so far because the form label stipulates what is expected. So Firefox users can write date & time instead. 



#### Tested user stories:

- *As a potential customer, I want to find information on the service (price, how does it work, etc.) and how to book the videocall easily.*

  The services details are quickly explained on the landing page. 

- *As a potential customer, I want to be able to read other customers' reviews before purchasing myself.*

  Some customers' reviews are displayed down the *index.html* page.

- *As an aspiring goat owner, I want to find information about Nigerian dwarf goats.* 

  Plenty info on goats & goats breeding can be found on the *wikigoat.html* page. 

- *As a parent, I want my child to learn about goats in a funny way.* 

  Plenty info on goats & some fun facts can be found on the *wikigoat.html* page.

- *As a coworker, I want to make a joke to my colleagues and have a goat in our next team videocall.* 

  The process to book a videocall is through the contact email, simply by contacting the owner of the farm to settle an e-meeting.
